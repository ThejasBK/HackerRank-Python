# Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

# Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

# Formula used: Average = sum_of_distinct_heights / total_no+of_distinct_heights

def average(array):
    resul = sum(set(arr))/len(set(arr))
    return resul
